/*

Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)

[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

*/

//Parameters: an array of varying length containing string values
//Results: an array of string containing the orginal values with the line number and a colon + space in front
//Examples:
//   assert.deepEqual(number([]), [], 'Empty array should return empty array');
//    assert.deepEqual(number(["a", "b", "c"]), ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

//Psuedocode: iterate of each array value and prepend the line number(starting with 1), and add a colon and a space between the line number and the value.

var number=function(array){
  console.log(array.map((alpha,index) => `${index + 1}: ${alpha}`))
}
